Harbour porpoise line transect data
===================================

Data used in paper "Mixture models for distance sampling detection functions" by David L. Miller and Len Thomas. Taken from Williams and Thomas (2007) and were provided by Rob Williams.

Data are line transect observations of 68 harbour porpoise clusters (Phocoena phocoena) in British Columbia. Both distance to animal and group/cluster size were collected.


Survey details
==============

Survey design and protocol are detailed in Williams et al 2007. Multi-species small boat surveys were conducted along the coastline of British Columbia, Canada during the summers of 2004 and 2005.


Data format
===========

Comma separated value file with one row for each of the 68 observations, each with the following 7 columns:

distance  : Exact perpendicular distances to observed ant nests in metres.
size      : Number of animals observed.
object    : Unique observation identifier.
observer  : Factor with 13 levels giving observer ID.
detected  : Column of 1s indicated that the individual was observed (needed for analysis software).
