Humpback whale line transect data
=================================

Data used in paper "Mixture models for distance sampling detection functions" by David L. Miller and Len Thomas. Taken from Williams and Thomas (2007) and were provided by Rob Williams.

Data are line transect observations of 76 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in British Columbia.


Survey details
==============

Survey design and protocol are detailed in Thomas et al 2007. Multi-species small boat surveys were conducted along the coastline of British Columbia, Canada during the summers of 2004 and 2005.


Data format
===========

Comma separated value file with one row for each of the 76 observations, each with the following 3 columns:

distance  : Exact perpendicular distances to observed humpbacks in metres.
object    : Unique observation identifier.
detected  : Column of 1s indicated that the individual was observed (needed for analysis software).
