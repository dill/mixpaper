pa-plot-mmds.pdf
Boxplots of Pa for each scenario and sample size, fitted using only MMDS methods.
Number along the bottom is the proportion of the time when the true model was
selected.
For the covar models, these are the ones where the covariate is "known" -- ie a model was fit with covars and
 without covars, and AIC was allowed to choose which it liked.  So, it doesn't include the case when the
 covariate was unknown.
I guess this is the one figure we'll include in the paper -- everything else in an appendix?

These are the CDS results - includ in web figure 2
Covar is the same as mmds plot.

pa-plot-combined.pdf shows Phat for the AIC best models. web figure 3
Figure D2.
See pa-plot-combined_LT.pdf
Numbers on the top: *should be* what proportion of times AIC best model is 2 or 3 point mixture
Numbers on the bottom: proportion of times AIC best model is the true model

bar-winners.pdf
Shows which models were AIC best in each iteration.  Nice.  Clear.  Web figure 4
See bar-winners_LT.pdf for changes needed.
