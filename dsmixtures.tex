One advantage over current methods is the mixtures are automatically monotonic non-increasing and non-negative, so constrained optimization is not required. The mixture formulation is compared to existing methods using extensive simulations and small case studies on real data. [[TKTKTK need to finish by reporting more on our results]]

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}


Distance sampling (Buckland et al., 2001, 2004) is a suite of methods for estimating the size or density of biological populations.  There are two main variants, line and point transects. The basic idea is the same in both: an observer visits a randomly-located set of transect lines or points and records the distance, $y$, from the transect to each objects of interest (i.e., animals or plants of the target species) that is detected within some truncation distance $w$.  Not all objects within $w$ are assumed to be detected; instead the observed distances are used to estimate the parameters, $\bm{\theta}$, of a detection function model , $g(y;\bm{\theta})$, which describes how the probability of detection declines with increasing distance.  An assumption of the basic method is that $g(0;\bm{\theta})=1$. Given estimates of $\bm{\theta}$, it is straightforward to estimate population size or density (see Section \ref{s:popsize}).

A key part of distance sampling, therefore, is specification of the detection function model.  Buckland et al. (2001, Chapter 2) provide a set of criteria for judging the utility of candidate model classes: models needs to be flexible, so that they can take a wide variety of shapes, but efficient in the sense of representing plausible shapes with few parameters; they should be flat at zero distance (i.e., $g'(0;\bm{\theta})=0$), and monotonic non-increasing with increasing distance (i.e., $g'(y;\bm{\theta}) \leq 0$ for $0<y\leq w$).  The authors recommend a semiparametric modelling approach developed by Buckland (1992), and this approach has become by far the most popular in practice, partly due to its inclusion in the industry-standard distance sampling analysis software Distance (Thomas et al., 2010).  However, as we demonstrate below, the approach has some drawbacks.  Our purpose in this paper is to propose an alternative class of models, based on mixtures, and to evaluate their utility.

The approach of Buckland (1992) was extended by Marques and Buckland (2004) to allow covariates in addition to distance to be included in the detection function, and, for maximum generality, it is this formulation that we describe here.  The detection function is thus denoted $g(y, \mathbf{z};\bm{\theta})$ where $\mathbf{z}$ is an observation-specific vector of covariates.  The formulation of Buckland (1992) is simply the special case where there are no additional covariates.

In Marques and Buckland (2004), the detection function is modelled as a parametric key function $k$ and series expansion $s$ of even functions (known as adjustment terms) with some parameters $\bm{\theta}$. $g$ is then written as:
\begin{equation*}
g(y, \mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta}) = \frac{k(y, \mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta}) \{1+s(y, \mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta})\}}{k(0, \mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta}) \{1+s(0, \mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta})\}},
\end{equation*}
where $k$ may be a half-normal, hazard-rate or uniform function and $s$ may be zero (i.e., there are no adjustment terms), cosine, simple even polynomial or Hermite polynomial series. The denominator ensures that detection at zero distance is certain (i.e., $g(0, \mathbf{z};\bm{\theta})=1$).  Models are fit to the distance data using maximum likelihood.  The recommended strategy for most situations is to choose a small set of key function and adjustment combinations, and for each combination to choose the number of adjustment terms using forward selection, i.e., start with no adjustment terms and fit an increasing number of terms, stopping when the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) fails to decrease.  The combination with the lowest AIC is then selected as the best model.  This strategy works well in practice in many cases: the key functions cover a range of realistic shapes for the detection function, so that often zero or one adjustments are sufficient to provide a good fit to the data, resulting in flexible and yet efficient estimation.  The functions are also flat at zero distance, and the key functions are non-increasing.  However, with the addition of adjustment terms, the resulting function is not necessarily non-increasing, nor does it necessarily lie within the interval $[0,1]$.  The solution to this implemented by default in Distance, when there are no additional covariates, is to use constrained maxmimizaion, taking 10 equally spaced distances $y_1=0, \ldots , y_{10}=w$ and ensuring that $g(y_i;\bm{\hat{\theta}})\geq g(y_{i+1}; \bm{\hat{\theta}})$ and that $g(y_{i+1};\bm{\hat{\theta}})\geq 0$ for $i=1,\ldots,9$.

This solution presents a number of problems. Firstly, constrained maximization is a harder problem, meaning in practice that optimization algorithms may fail to find the maximum.  Secondly, constrained maximum likelihood estimates do not have the same appealing properties as their unconstrained cousins -- for example the usual estimator of the standard error of the parameters (square root of the inverse of the information matrix) can be biased.  Thirdly, constraints can only be applied at a finite number of points (10 in the case of Distance), which can lead to the constraint points missing non-monotonic parts of the function.  An example from the recent literature (Williams and Thomas, 2007) is shown in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig1}.  Lastly, it is not clear how to implement the constraints in the case where there are additional covariates, particularly continuous covariates.  One (computationally expensive) option would be to apply the constraints at every observed covariate combintion; however at present Distance uses unconstrained optimization when additional covariates are in the model.  Difficulties arising from this are illustrated in the central and right panels of Figure \ref{fig1} (from Pike et al., 2003), where a strongly non-monotonic function has been fit for some covariate values.  Detection probability estimates outside the range [0,1] are sometimes encountered in Distance during maximization with covariates (in which case the fitting algorithms fail).  Given all of the above, it may be preferable to use a formulation that guarantees monotonicity from the outset.

The first panel is data from humpback whale (Williams and Thomas, 2007): a half-normal detection function with cosine adjustments provided the best fit to the data but, even with constraints in place, the detection function is non-monotonic, with a small secondary peak at approx. 1500m. The second and third panels are data from long-finned pilot whale (Pike et al., 2003) where again a half-normal plus cosine model was fit, but with Beaufort sea state as a covariate and no monotonicity constraints since they cannot be used for multiple covariate models in Distance.  The middle panel shows the detection function averaged over the covariate values and the left panel the marginal detection function for 25th, 50th and 75th quantiles of the Beaufort sea state covariate: non-monotonicity occurs at.}

Mixture models have recently been applied in the capture-recapture literature following the work of Pledger (2000), Dorazio and Royle (2003), Pledger (2005) and Morgan \& Ridout (2008). Their main utility in capture-recapture is in better accounting for between-individual heterogeneity, which can cause severe bias if unmodelled (Link, 2003). In distance sampling this problem does not arise, provided that detection at zero distance is certain, the heterogeneity is not extreme, and a flexible detection function model is used (Buckland, 2004, Section 11.12). Mixture models offer the potential for flexible modelling since the individual parts of the mixture model (the mixture components) can be combined in various ways to yeild a great many possible shapes, and yet all of these will be monotonic non-increasing so long as each component is monotonic non-increasing.  This is the motivation behind the work presented here.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of distance sampling detection function models, based on mixtures of simple parametric key functions.  In the next section, we describe the models.  We then illustrate their use in Section 3 by applying them to simulated data, and then to real data from a number of studies in Section 4. We finish with a discussion of the utility of these new methods.


\section{Finite mixture model detection functions}

\subsection{Formulation}
\label{s:detfcts}

Denoting the detection function as $g$, we consider a sum of $J$ mixture components $g_j$, scaled by some mixture proportions $\phi_j$:
\begin{equation*}
g(y,\mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta}, \bm{\phi}) = \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j g_j(y,\mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta}_j),
\end{equation*}
where $\sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j = 1$. The (radial or perpendicular) distance is denoted $y$, the $\bm{\theta}_j$s are vectors of parameters for function $g_j$, $\bm{\theta}$ is a vector containing of all of the $\bm{\theta}_j$s, $\bm{\phi}$ is a vector of all of the $\phi_j$s, and $\mathbf{z}$ is an a $K$-vector of the associated covariates.  

Here we let the $g_j$s be half-normal functions (although other monotonic functions such as hazard-rate could be chosen and the $g_j$s need not all have the same form), so
\begin{equation*}
g(y,\mathbf{z}; \bm{\theta}, \bm{\phi}) = \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j \exp \Big( - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma_j^2} \Big).
\end{equation*}
Covariates can be included in a similar way to Marques and Buckland (2004) (see also Marques et al., 2007), where the covariates affect the scale parameter $\sigma$. We assume that each mixture component has a different scale but that the covariates affect the scale parameters in the same way. Other more complex models may be possible.

Following the notation in Marques and Buckland (2004) and using $i$ to subscript each observation, our formulation for the scale parameter $\sigma_{ij}$, is therefore:
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{ij} = \exp( \beta_{0j} + \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k z_{ik}),
\end{equation*}
where $z_{ik}$ is the $k^\text{th}$ covariate for the $i^\text{th}$ observation. As an example, for a 2-point mixture with one covariate, the scale parameters take the form
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{ij} = \exp( \beta_{0j} + \beta_1 z_{i1}),
\end{equation*}
and then $\bm{\theta}_j = (\beta_{0j}, \beta_1)$. 


\subsection{Likelihood}
\label{s:likelihood}

Maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the parameters of the detection function. Before we can perform the optimization, we must first formulate a likelihood. Following from Buckland et al (2001, 2004), we can write the pdf of the observed distances ($f(y,\bm{z}; \bm{\theta}) $) as the ratio of the detection function and its integral:
\begin{equation}
f(y,\bm{z}; \bm{\theta}) = \frac{g(y,\bm{z}; \bm{\theta})}{\int_0^w g(y,\bm{z}; \bm{\theta}) \text{d}y}.
\end{equation}
The likelihood can then be formed by taking product of these pdfs over the $n$ observations, as usual.

For line transects, given a set of perpendicular distances $\{x_i; i=1,\ldots,n\}$ and associated covariate vectors $\bm{z}_i$ (which are the rows of the $n \times K$ matrix $\mathbf{Z}$), the likelihood is given by:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\phi}; \mathbf{x},\mathbf{Z}) &= \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta},\bm{\phi})\\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{g(x_i,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta},\bm{\phi})}{\mu_i}\\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j g_j(x_i,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta}_j)}{\mu_i}
\end{align*}
where $\mu_i$, the effective strip width, is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j \int_0^w  g_j(x,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta}_j) \text{d}x.
\end{equation*}

For point transects, with radial distances $\{r_i; i=1,\ldots,n\}$ and associated covariate vectors $\bm{z}_i$ (which again form the rows of the $n\times K$ matrix $\mathbf{Z}$), the likelihood is:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\phi}; \mathbf{r},\mathbf{Z}) &= \prod_{i=1}^n f(r_i,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta},\bm{\phi})\\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{2 \pi r_i g(r_i,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta},\bm{\phi})}{\nu_i}\\
&= \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{2 \pi r_i \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j g_j(r_i,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta}_j)}{\nu_i}
\end{align*}
where the effective area of detection, $\nu_i$ is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
\nu_i = 2\pi \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j \int_0^w  r g_j(r,\bm{z}_i; \bm{\theta}_j) \text{d}r.
\end{equation*}
Parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood. Practicalities associated with this maximization, along with analytic derivatives of the likelihood are described in Web Appendices A and B.

In this paper, we have assumed that the distance data are in the form of ``exact'' distances from detected objects to the transect; an alternative is that distances are grouped into intervals, with pre-defined cutpoints (e.g., 0-10m, 10-20m, etc.), so that the data are the distance interval of each observation.  In this case, a multinomial likelihood is obtained (see, e.g., Buckland et al., 2001, Section 3.3.2).

\subsection{Estimating population size}
\label{s:popsize}

[[Need to edit stuff here now I've edited the intro.]]

As mentioned above, population size can be found using the Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator given in (\ref{HT}). In the mixture model case $p_i$  (the probability of the $i\text{th}$ observation being detected given it is within the sampled area) is given by:
\begin{equation*}
p_i = \frac{1}{w} \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j \int_0^w  g_j(x,\mathbf{Z}; \bm{\theta}_j) \text{d}x,
\end{equation*}
for line transects and for point transects by
\begin{equation*}
p_i = \frac{2\pi}{w^2} \sum_{j=1}^J \phi_j \int_0^w  r g_j(r,\mathbf{Z}; \bm{\theta}_j) \text{d}r.
\end{equation*}
A standard summary statistic is the average detection probability for an animal within the covered region [[[did you define covered region earlier?]], $P_a$, which is given by:
\begin{equation*}
P_a = n/N.
\end{equation*}
Estimators for the variances of $N$ and $P_a$ are given in Web Appendix E.


\section{Simulations}
\label{s:sims}

Extensive simulations were carried out to investigate performance, in terms of the accuracy of estimation of $P_a$ and $N$, under the circumstance when the true model is not known to the estimation procedure. Each simulation involved generating 200 replicate datasets from a specified mixture model, fitting each dataset with 1-, 2-, and 3-point mixture models for the detection function, and in each case recording estimated parameter values and abundance from the model with the lowest AIC.

[[ Need to add in some blurb about the hazard rate mixtures ]]

Four sets of simulations were run:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Non-covariate 2-point detection functions for line transect data. Four different detection functions were tested; these are illustrated in the first row of Figure \ref{sim-detfcts}. The first two should be relatively easy to fit. The third should be harder, testing the behaviour of the model when the scale parameter of one of the mixture components is very large relative to the truncation distance. Finally, the fourth detection function has a large spike (i.e., a sharp decline in detectability at small distances), which is similar to that in some of the data we analyse in Section \ref{s:data}.
	\item Non-covariate 2-point detection functions for point transect data.  The detection functions were as above, with data generated as if it came from point transects. The pdfs are given in the second row of Figure \ref{sim-detfcts}.
	\item Non-covariate 3-point detection functions for line transect data. Two different models for the detection functions were used. They are shown in the third row of Figure \ref{sim-detfcts}. The first is much like the second line transect detection function, enabling us to investigate the efficacy of model selection. The second is a more complex shape that could only be created using a 3-point mixture; it has the added complication (as with the third line transect simulation) that one of the components has a large scale parameter relative to truncation distance.
	\item Covariate 2-point detection functions for line transect data. Two different models were tested, the first of which has a binary factor covariate: half of the observations had covariate value 1 and half had covariate value 0. The second model had a continuous covariate, whose values were generated from a standard normal distribution function. Detection functions are shown in the fourth row of Figure \ref{sim-detfcts}, along with the marginal detection functions for the levels/quantiles of the covariates. One goal was to test the properties of the estimator in the presence of covariates, and for these runs we included the covariate in all models fit.  However, we additionally wished to evaluate the performance of the mixture model formulation in cases where a covariate affects detectability but the covariate is not available to the observer.  We therefore fit the same simulated datasets with mixture models that did not include covariates, and compared the resulting estimates to their with-covariate counterparts.
\end{enumerate}

True parameters and average detectabilities are given in Web Appendix C.

Top row: detection functions for the line transect simulations with no covariates (solid lines) and their constituent mixture components (dashed lines). Second row: pdfs for the point transect simulations with no covariates (bold lines), with associates component pdfs, rescaled so the area under each curve is one; the detection functions are as in the top row. Third row: two 3-point mixtures for non-covariate line transect data, again with components as dashed lines. Fourth row, two covariate models, the first two panels are for a binary covariate, the second two for a continuous covariate; first panels in each pair show the detection function averaged over the covariates (along with the mixture components, similarly averaged) and the second panels show marginal detection functions with the levels (or quantiles) of the detection function.}

[[probably need to re-write and/or cut this down]]

Results from the simulation study are shown in Figure \ref{sim-boxplots}. Boxplots are of the estimated average detection probability, $\hat{P_a}$. The number under each boxplot gives the proportion of AIC best models that were of the same form as the true model (i.e. same number of mixture components and same covariates selected). For the first row (line transects with no covariates) we can see that in scenarios 1 and 3, both the true model and true probability of detection were found, even at low sample sizes; whereas in scenarios 2 and 4 there was a positive bias in the estimates of the probability of detection as well as a lower proportion of ``correct'' models being selected by AIC. In scenario 2 and 4 most of the weight (0.7 and 0.6, respectively) is given to the larger mixture component, thus the smaller component is swamped; making the simulated data look as if it were generated from a 1-point mixture.

This effect can also be seen in the point transect simulations, but more severely. In this case one can see from the second row of Figure \ref{sim-detfcts} that the pdfs of the distances look very much like only one of the components of the mixture. Fitting only a 1-point mixture to data from a 2-point mixture has lead to a positive bias in the detection probabilities, however this is only to expected given that data generated from such models would look like a 1-point mixture.

The results from the first of the 3-point mixtures show that detection function can be easily represented using a smaller number of mixture terms. At sample sizes of 120 and lower, a 1-point mixture model dominated (around 150 of the AIC selected models were 1-point mixtures) then at the two higher sample sizes, 2-point mixtures dominated. Scenario 2 is more like a ``true'' 3-point data set, although only at the two larger sample sizes was a 3-point model selected more than half of the time. Note that at the lower sample sizes, a 2-point mixture was selected more often than 1-point (137, 173 and 182 times for the lowest three sample sizes). This effect may be due to the large, potentially non-identifiable, scale parameter being confounded with the other parameters, although this did not appear to be problematic in the scenario 2 of the line transect non-covariate models, above.

The covariate models again show an initial positive bias in the $P_a$ estimates but do still converge to the true value at higher sample sizes (bottom row of Figure \ref{sim-boxplots}). The numbers beneath the boxplots mask rather more for the covariate models than in the other cases, since model selection was performed on not only the number of mixtures but also on the inclusion of covariates. At the larger two sample sizes we see that the ``true'' model is selected almost all of the time. However,  at smaller sample sizes we see more interesting behaviour. For scenario 1, at the two lowest sample sizes a 1-point non-covariate model dominates, followed by 1-point with covariates, then 2-point covariate and 2-point non-covariate. So, as one would expect, the simplest two models are selected most, but the added information from the covariates means that the 2-point covariate is selected ahead of the 2-point non-covariate. At sample size 120, the 1- and 2-point covariate models are both selected about 70 times, and the non-covariate 1- and 2-point models about 30 times. Contrary to expectations the 3-point mixtures are barely selected at all (with or without covariates) leading us to believe that the covariates cannot simply be substituted by further mixture terms, even in the binary covariate case. Scenario 2 shows a slightly different picture; the non-covariate models are selected less, even at lower sample sizes (the 1-point covariate model was selected 90 times a the lowest sample size) which might be expected given that scenario 2 included a continuous covariate. As was the case for scenario 1, the 3-point models were barely selected at all. In both scenarios there seems to be a ``bite point'' between a sample size of 120 and 480 where the correct model is selected almost every time.

[[ For the covariate models, when fitting an MCDS model with covariates, AIC would select non-monotonic models with vastly lower AICs (-2500, next lowest model was -600) with very different abundance estimates. Since we would not select such non-monotone models in a real analysis, the MCDS models were fitted without adjustments. (Maybe say something about Jeff's complaints here, maybe not).]]

\section{Case studies}
\label{s:data}

Given the performance of the method in simulation, several data sets were analysed using the method. Analyses were performed in \texttt{mmds} (Mixture Model Distance Sampling), an \textsf{R} package written by the authors and available on CRAN. Results from using mixture model detection functions are compared with those from the original articles.

[[\textbf{LEN}: is further detail needed for any of these?]]

\subsection{Williams and Thomas (2007) cetacean survey}

Williams and Thomas (2007) study several species of cetaceans off the coast of British Columbia. In particular we look at three species: harbour seal (in water), harbour porpoise and humpback whale (with truncation at 500m, 500m and 2000m respectively). Results are summarised in Table \ref{williams-table} and detection functions for the best (in an AIC sense) models are shown in Figure \ref{williams-detfcts}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Comparison of the results for the Williams and Thomas (2007) data. W\&T indicates the results reported in Williams and Thomas (2007), other results are from mixture models where the number of mixture components was selected by AIC. $\cos(x)$ indicates a Cosine adjustment of order $x$.}

(in water) & Hn 2-pt  & 2769.86 & 0.335 & 15.38 & 0.945\\
Harbour porpoise & Hr (W\&T) & 690.66 & 0.212 & 32.0 & 0.99\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{williams-table}
\end{table}

In each case a 2-point mixture was selected by AIC to be the best model. The mixture models for the harbour porpoise and the humpback both did not perform as well as the models selected in Williams and Thomas (2007). However, for the harbour porpoise the AIC is only different by 2, the detectability is very similar and the \%CV is lower, so it does not appear that much is lost by using the mixture model. In the case of the humpback, the fitted detection function is monotone, which was not the case in Williams and Thomas (2007); this added to the fact that there is again not a huge difference in results, leads us to believe that mixture models for the detection function can be useful. Finally, for the harbour seal data, the mixture model had a better AIC than the half-normal with cosine adjustments of order 2 which was selected in the paper. The goodness-of-fit was also significantly better than the result given in Williams and Thomas (2007).

\subsection{Wood ants in the Abernethy forest}

Borkin, Summers and Thomas (2012) analyse data on two species of wood ant (\textit{Formica aquilonia} and \textit{Formica lugubris}) in the Abernethy Forest in Strathspey Scotland over the period of August--September 2003. The number of nests sighted was 150 out to a distance of 72.04m from the track line, although 45\% of the nest sightings lay within 4m of the line. As part of their analysis several different truncation distances were used and larger truncation distances led to large variance in the encounter rate estimates and hence in overall abundance estimates (see Borkin et al., 2012). This is due to the spike caused by the large number of detections close to the line.

As well as distances, three covariates were recorded: habitat type (\texttt{habitat}, a four level factor), the size (calculated as half-width multiplied by height) of each nest (\texttt{nest.size}, continuous variable) and whether \textit{Formica aquilonia} or \textit{Formica lugubris} were observed (\texttt{species}, a two level factor). In order to avoid numerical problems due to large values of the nest size, the variable was standardised.

As can be seen from Table \ref{big-results-table}, the best model by AIC was a 2-point mixture with nest size and habitat as covariates. This is not that surprising given the best CDS model (selected by AIC) in Distance was a hazard-rate with the same covariates. What is rather surprising is that the best mixture model had a better AIC than the hazard-rate, even though it has 1 more parameter. This is particularly encouraging since one might expect that mixtures would give good fits but would not achieve lower AIC scores due to the number of parameters required.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Long-finned pilot whales}

Pike et al. (2003) analyse data on long-finned pilot whales (\textit{Globicephala melas}). There were 84 pods sighted as part of the NASS-2001 survey (of which the pilot whale was not a target). The Beaufort sea state was recorded as a covariate during the survey and enter the model as either a continuous variable (\texttt{BSS}), 6 level factor (\texttt{BSS}, as a factor), a 2 level factor (\texttt{BSS3}) or a 3 level factor (\texttt{BSS2}).

A model was fit with each of these covariates, as well as a model with no covariates. A summary of the results is given in Table \ref{big-results-table} and the detection function for the best model is shown in Figure \ref{danpike-detfct}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{analyses/danpike-bssc.eps}

\label{danpike-detfct}
\end{figure}

The best model by AIC score was a 2-point mixture with \texttt{BSS} as a continuous covariate. Figure \ref{danpike-detfct} shows the average detection function and the marginal detection function with the quantiles of \texttt{BSS}. As one would expect, none of the non-monotonic behaviour seen in Figure \ref{fig1} can be seen here.

\subsection{Amakihi}
Marques et al. (2007) analyse data on the Hawaii Amakihi (\textit{Hemignathus virens}). The data consist of 1485 observations on the bird ($n=1243$ after truncation at 82.5m), collected at 41 point transect from July 1992 to April 1995. Data was also collected on three covariates: the observer (\texttt{obs} , a three level factor), minutes after sunrise (\texttt{mas}, continuous, standardised to prevent numerical issues) and hours after sunrise (\texttt{has}, a six level factor).

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{analyses/amakihi-om.eps}\\
\includegraphics[width=0.3333\textwidth, trim=0 0 7.133334in 0, clip=true]{analyses/amakihi-om.eps}\includegraphics[width=0.6666\textwidth, trim=3.566667in 0 0 0, clip=true]{analyses/amakihi-om-hh.eps}\\

Bottom row: pdf of distances averaged over the covariate values.}
\label{amakihi}
\end{figure}

Best mixture model according to AIC was a two point mixture with observer and minutes after sunrise as covariates (shown in Figure \ref{amakihi}), closely followed by the model with only observer as a covariate (see Table \ref{big-results-table}). In this case a hazard-rate with observer and minutes after sunrise as covariates beat the mixtures in AIC terms. This is not too surprising given that the mixtures use one more parameter than a hazard-rate in this situation. It is encouraging that there is such a small difference in AIC, and that covariate mixture models were selected despite the large number of parameters that such models entail.

\section{Discussion}
\label{s:discuss}

[[\textbf{LEN}: I've put some stuff here but it's a bit rough at the moment. ]]

[[Something here about how you can work out how many there are in each class? See Takis e-mail...]]


We have investigated and demonstrated the utility of detection functions constructed from mixtures of half-normals in both line and point transect distance sampling. We also show that covariates can be included in such models easily. These mixture detection functions can be simply ``dropped in'' to the existing theory. This means mark-recapture distance sampling methods (Laake et al., 2011), spatial models for distance sampling data (Hedley, Buckland and Borchers, 2004), methods for incomplete detection at zero distance (Laake and Borchers, 2004) and other advanced distance sampling methods can exploit this formulation.

We have shown that the method performs well on both simulated and case studies where traditional methods produce unrealistic results. In many cases the proposed model outperformed (M)CDS models in AIC terms, which is surprising given that the mixture models in question often had more parameters. 

Simulations show that small sample sizes do not support the use of mixture models with high number of components, even when the data were generated from such a model. We avoid poorly fitting models of this sort by using AIC forward selection for the number of mixtures, ensuring model parsimony.

In simulation we observed that 3-point mixture did not act as good surrogates for missing covariate structure in the model; 2-point mixtures were generally chosen by AIC as good models. We also note that the construction of a true 3-point mixture is quite tricky. In the examples in Section \ref{s:data}, 2-point mixtures consistently provided the best fit, even in the case of the amakihi data which had many observations ($n=1243$). Only examination of further data will show whether 3-point and higher mixtures can be supported, however we note that when the K$+$A series formulation is used, detection functions with 5 or more parameters are rarely selected by AIC (a 3-point mixture with no covariates requires 5 parameters).

All the models discussed in this article are available as an \textsf{R} package, \texttt{mmds} which is available from \url{http://www.github.com/dill/mmds/}. Mixture model detection functions will be available in the next version of the Distance software.

Further work will include extending these models further to include continuous mixtures. In that case the detection function can be modelled as:
\begin{equation*}
g(x) = \int_\mathbf{R} \varphi(\kappa) g_\kappa(x,\mathbf{Z}; \theta, \kappa) \text{d}\kappa
\end{equation*}
where $\varphi(\kappa)$ is some function which controls the mixing of $g_\kappa$. Such an approach may present significant computation issues, however the benefits of a significantly more flexible detection function may be considerable. Provided that an appropriate function can be chosen for $\varphi$, more flexible models could be used whilst keeping the number of parameters low. In addition, a combination of both finite and continuous mixtures could be used, echoing the work of Morgan and Ridout (2008) in capture-recapture.
